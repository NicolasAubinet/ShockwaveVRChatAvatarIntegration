This is a Unity plugin to easily integrate Shockwave suit compatible haptics to your VRChat avatar.

In your avatar Unity project, start byadding a package from this git URL: https://github.com/NicolasAubinet/ShockwaveVRChatAvatarIntegration.git

You'll then have a new Shockwave menu when right clicking on your avatar. Just click on "Add haptics to avatar" to add all the required colliders.

You also have the options to enable or disable self-collisions, and remove haptics.

To actually trigger haptics, you need to run this app on your PC https://github.com/NicolasAubinet/ShockwaveVRChat
